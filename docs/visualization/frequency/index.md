# Frequency

CARET is able to show you frequencies of callback execution, message communication, and invocation of publisher or subscription.  
`Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(target_object)` interface is provided for it.
This section describes sample visualization scripts for them.
Execute the following script code to load trace data and an architecture object before calling this method.

```python
from caret_analyze.plot import Plot
from caret_analyze import Application, Architecture, Lttng
from bokeh.plotting import output_notebook, figure, show
output_notebook()
arch = Architecture('yaml', '/path/to/architecture_file')
lttng = Lttng('/path/to/trace_data')
app = Application(arch, lttng)
```

## Callback

`Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(callbacks: Collections[CallbackBase])` is introduced to confirm whether targeted callback functions were running at desired frequency.

```python
### Timestamp tables
plot = Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(app.callbacks)
frequency_df = plot.to_dataframe()
frequency_df

# ---Output in jupyter-notebook as below---
```

![callback_frequency_df](../../imgs/callback_frequency_df.png)

```python
### Time-series graph
plot = Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(app.callbacks)
plot.show()

# ---Output in jupyter-notebook as below---
```

![callback_frequency_time_line](../../imgs/callback_frequency_time_line.png)

The horizontal axis means time, labeled as `Time [s]`. `xaxis_type` argument is prepared to select index of x-axis among Linux system time, [ROS simulation time](../../recording/sim_time.md), and 0-based ordering. One of `'system_time'`, `'sim_time'` and `'index'` is chosen as `xaxis_type` though `'system_time'` is the default value.
The vertical axis means frequency of callback execution, labeled as `Frequency [Hz]`. It is plotted per second.

## Communication

`Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(communications: Collection[Communication])` is introduced to confirm targeted topic is communicated at expected frequency.  
Here, CARET takes into account communication when both transmission and reception on a message are performed successfully without being lost.
See [Premise of communication](../premise_of_communication.md) for more details.

!!! info
    Current implementation of CARET does not behave as explained above. In this moment, CARET counts not only successful communication but also failure ones for calculating frequency. This implementation will be improved in the near future.
<prettier-ignore-end>

```python
### Timestamp tables
plot = Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(app.communications)
frequency_df = plot.to_dataframe()
frequency_df

# ---Output in jupyter-notebook as below---
```

![comm_frequency_df](../../imgs/comm_frequency_df.png)

```python
### Time-series graph
plot = Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(app.communications)
plot.show()

# ---Output in jupyter-notebook as below---
```

![communication_frequency_time_line](../../imgs/communication_frequency_time_line.png)

The horizontal axis means time, labeled as `Time [s]` while the vertical axis means frequency of communication, labeled as `Frequency [Hz]` as well as time-series graph for callback execution. `xaxis_type` argument is provided as well.

## Publish and Subscription

`Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(Collection[publish: Publisher or subscription: Subscriber])` is introduced to check how frequent target publisher or subscription is invoked.

```python
### Timestamp tables
plot = Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(*app.publishers, *app.subscriptions)
frequency_df = plot.to_dataframe()
frequency_df

# ---Output in jupyter-notebook as below---
```

![pub_sub_frequency_df](../../imgs/pub_sub_frequency_df.png)

```python
### Time-series graph
plot = Plot.create_frequency_timeseries_plot(*app.publishers, *app.subscriptions)
plot.show()

# ---Output in jupyter-notebook as below---
```

![pub_sub_frequency_time_line](../../imgs/pub_sub_frequency_time_line.png)

The horizontal axis means time, labeled as `Time [s]` while the vertical axis means invocation frequency of publish or subscription, labeled as `Frequency [Hz]` as well as time-series graph for callback execution. `xaxis_type` argument is provided as well.
