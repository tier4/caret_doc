# Installation

## Requirements

CARET is confirmed to run on the platforms shown in the following table with supported version.

| dependent platform | supported version |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| ROS                | Humble            |
| Ubuntu             | 22.04             |
| LTTng              | stable-2.13       |
| Linux Kernel       | 5.15.x            |
| Python3            | 3.10.x            |

The recent version, after v0.3.0, of CARET supports only the combination of ROS 2 Humble and Ubuntu 22.04.  
We have added an experimental implementation to work with iron.  
For setup of each distribution, please open each tab.  
To install for jazzy, open `for jazzy` in the Installation section below and follow the instructions.

## Installation

Installation using meta repository is the least time-consuming way to install CARET.  
With meta repository and Ansible, you can skip the laborious manual setup which is explained in manual installation(./manual_installation.md) section (written in Japanese).

Please execute the following steps on Ubuntu 22.04. The order is important so that you have to follow the steps in order.

   <details>
   <summary>for jazzy</summary>

Currently, jazzy assumes installation in a virtual environment.
First, create and activate the virtual environment with the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv

virtualenv -p python3 --system-site-packages $HOME/venv/jazzy
source $HOME/venv/jazzy/bin/activate
```

1. Clone `caret` and enter the directory.
<prettier-ignore-end>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tier4/caret.git ros2_caret_ws
cd ros2_caret_ws
```

<prettier-ignore-start>
2. Create the src directory and clone repositories into it.
<prettier-ignore-end>

CARET uses vcstool to construct workspaces.

=== "humble"

    ``` bash
    mkdir src
    vcs import src < caret.repos
    ```

=== "iron"

    ``` bash
    mkdir src
    vcs import src < caret_iron.repos
    ```

=== "jazzy"

    ``` bash
    mkdir src
    vcs import src < caret_jazzy.repos
    ```

<prettier-ignore-start>
3. Run `setup_caret.sh`.
<prettier-ignore-end>

=== "humble"

    ``` bash
    ./setup_caret.sh
    ```

=== "iron"

    ``` bash
    ./setup_caret.sh -d iron
    ```

=== "jazzy"

    ``` bash
    ./setup_caret.sh -d jazzy
    ```

<prettier-ignore-start>
4. Build the workspace.
<prettier-ignore-end>

=== "humble"

    ``` bash
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```

=== "iron"

    ``` bash
    source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash
    colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```

=== "jazzy"

    ``` bash
    source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
    colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```

<prettier-ignore-start>
5. Check whether CARET (ros2-tracing) is enabled.
<prettier-ignore-end>

CARET inherits some functions from [ros2-tracing](https://gitlab.com/ros-tracing/ros2_tracing).

```bash
source ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/local_setup.bash
ros2 run tracetools status # return Tracing enabled
```

If you see `Tracing enabled`, you can continue to apply CARET to your application.
