### v0.4.10 <small>\_ Jun 12, 2023</small> {id = "0.4.10"}

- **Update**: Changed trace points used to tie records of inter-process communication. This change affects trace data compatibility. However, this only affects cases where trace data captured after this update is analyzed by caret_analyze before this update. In that case, update caret_analyze ([CARET_analyze #296](https://github.com/tier4/CARET_analyze/pull/296)), ([CARET_trace #113](https://github.com/tier4/CARET_trace/pull/113)), ([CARET_doc #191](https://github.com/tier4/CARET_doc/pull/191)), ([ros2caret #70](https://github.com/tier4/ros2caret/pull/70))
  - Please see the table below for the supported combinations

|                               | trace data (<=0.4.9) | trace data (>=v0.4.10) |
