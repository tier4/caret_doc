# Recording

## Recording with CARET

CARET uses LTTng for tracing a target application. A LTTng session has to be started before running the application. This page explains two different ways for it: Starting LTTng session manually and Starting LTTng session using ROS launch system.

Explanation in this page assumes CARET is installed to `~/ros2_caret_ws` and the sample application used in the tutorial section is located in `~/ros2_ws`.

## Starting LTTng session manually

Two terminals are needed for this method: One for starting a LTTng session, another for running a target application.

1. Open a terminal and start a LTTng session with the following commands

   - (Optional) `ROS_TRACE_DIR` variable is a destination directory where recorded trace data will be stored. Default is `~/.ros/tracing`
   - With "`-s`" option, you can give session name. The recorded trace data will be stored into `~/ros_ws/evaluate/e2e_sample` in this sample
   - Press "Enter" key to start a session

   ```sh
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

   # (Optional) Set a destination directory
   mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/evaluate
   export ROS_TRACE_DIR=~/ros2_ws/evaluate

   ros2 trace -s e2e_sample -k -u "ros2*"
   # Start session with pressing Enter key
   ```

2. Open another terminal and launch a target application

   - Perform environment settings in the same order as below. CARET's `local_setup.bash` should be applied along with ROS 2's `setup.bash` as the target application refers to CARET/rclcpp

     ```sh
     # Environment settings (keep the order as below)
     source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
     source ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/local_setup.bash
     source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
     ```

   - Set `LD_PRELOAD` to enable tracepoints provided by function hook

     ```sh
     export LD_PRELOAD=$(readlink -f ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/caret_trace/lib/libcaret.so)
     ```

   - (Optional) Apply [trace filtering](./trace_filtering.md). With configuration of trace filtering, CARET can ignore unnecessary nodes/topics. This function is useful for a large application

     ```sh
     # Apply filter directly
     export CARET_IGNORE_NODES="/rviz*"
     export CARET_IGNORE_TOPICS="/clock:/parameter_events"

     # Apply filter using a setting file
     source ./caret_topic_filter.bash
     ```

   - Launch the target application

     ```sh
     ros2 run caret_demos end_to_end_sample
     ```

3. Stop the target application

4. Press "Enter" key to stop the LTTng session in the terminal where the LTTng session runs

      A LTTng session needs to be started before running a target application. Otherwise, some trace points won't be recorded and analysis will fail later.

      You may find that size of recorded data is strangely smaller than expected after updating LTTng to 2.13 if you apply CARET to a large application like [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) which has hundreds of nodes. You have to suspect that maximum number of file descriptors is not enough in the case. You can check the number with `ulimit -n` command. The default maximum number is 1024, but it is not enough for the large application. You can avoid this problem by enlarging the maximum number with executing the command; `ulimit -n 65536`.

## Starting LTTng session via ROS launch

You can start LTTng session using ROS launch system. When you start a LTTng session in one terminal, you have to open another terminal for executing a target application as explained above. Operating multiple terminals is laborious for users. Launching LTTng session along with application by ROS launch is a reasonable way to apply CARET repeatedly.

1. Create a launch file for a target application in ROS general manner if you haven't made it

   ```py
   # launch/end_to_end_sample.launch.py
   import launch
   import launch_ros.actions


   def generate_launch_description():
       return launch.LaunchDescription([
           launch_ros.actions.Node(
               package='caret_demos', executable='end_to_end_sample', output='screen'),
       ])
   ```

2. Add description to start a LTTng session

   ```py
   # launch/end_to_end_sample_with_lttng_session.launch.py
   import launch
   import launch_ros.actions
   from tracetools_launch.action import Trace


   def generate_launch_description():
       return launch.LaunchDescription([
           Trace(
               session_name='e2e_sample',
               events_kernel=[],
               events_ust=['ros2*']
           ),
           launch_ros.actions.Node(
               package='caret_demos', executable='end_to_end_sample', output='screen'),
       ])
   ```

3. Launch a target application and a LTTng session via the launch file

   - Environment settings are still needed, but all operations are performed in just one terminal

   ```sh
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   source ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/local_setup.bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash

   export LD_PRELOAD=$(readlink -f ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/caret_trace/lib/libcaret.so)

   source ./caret_topic_filter.bash

   ros2 launch caret_demos end_to_end_sample_with_lttng_session.launch.py
   ```

## Advanced: Useful settings for launch file

- The following script shows advanced settings for a launch file
- `caret_session` option is used to set a session name. If not assigned, datetime (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS) is used
- `caret_light` option is used to add another event filter. Only events specified in `caret_event` variable are recorded. In this example, high level events, such as ros2:rclcpp layer, are recorded if `caret_light` is set to "true". This setting will be helpful to record a huge application.
  - Please refer to [tracepoint summary](./cli_tool.md#tracepoint-summary) to find which events are recorded, and modify `caret_event` as you want.

```py
# launch/end_to_end_sample_with_lttng_session.launch.py
import launch
import launch_ros.actions
from tracetools_launch.action import Trace

import sys
import datetime
from distutils.util import strtobool


def generate_launch_description():
  caret_session = ""
  caret_event = ["ros2*"]
  caret_light = True

  for arg in sys.argv:
    if arg.startswith("caret_session:="):
      caret_session = arg.split(":=")[1]
    elif arg.startswith("caret_light:="):
      try:
        caret_light = strtobool(arg.split(":=")[1]) # 0 or 1
      except:
        print("Invalid arguments 'caret_light'.")
        print("Start tracing with 'ros2*'.")

  if caret_light:
    caret_event = [ "ros2:*callback*",
            "ros2:dispatch*",
            "ros2:rclcpp*" ,
            "ros2_caret:rmw*",
            "*callback_group*",
            "ros2_caret:*executor",
            "ros2_caret:dds_bind*",
            "ros2:rcl_*init"]

  if caret_session == "":
    dt_now = datetime.datetime.now()
    caret_session = "autoware_launch_trace_" + dt_now.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")

  return launch.LaunchDescription([
    Trace(
      session_name=caret_session,
      events_kernel=[],
      events_ust=caret_event
    ),
    launch_ros.actions.Node(
        package='caret_demos', executable='end_to_end_sample', output='screen'),
  ])
```
