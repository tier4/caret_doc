# Recording

## Recording with CARET

CARET uses LTTng for tracing a target application.
This page explains two different ways for tracing: Starting LTTng session manually and Starting LTTng session using ROS launch system.

Explanation in this page assumes CARET is installed to `~/ros2_caret_ws` and the sample application used in the tutorial section is located in `~/ros2_ws`.

## Starting LTTng session manually

Two terminals are needed for this method; one for executing a target application, another for starting a LTTng session.

1. Open a terminal and launch a target application

   - Perform environment settings in the same order as below. CARET's `local_setup.bash` should be applied along with ROS 2's `setup.bash` as the target application refers to CARET/rclcpp

     ```sh
     # Environment settings (keep the order as below)
     source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
     source ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/local_setup.bash
     source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
     ```

   - Set `LD_PRELOAD` to enable tracepoints provided by function hook

     ```sh
     export LD_PRELOAD=$(readlink -f ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/caret_trace/lib/libcaret.so)
     ```

   - (Optional) Apply [trace filtering](./trace_filtering.md). With configuration of trace filtering, CARET can ignore unnecessary nodes/topics. This function is useful for a large application

     ```sh
     # Apply filter directly
     export CARET_IGNORE_NODES="/rviz*"
     export CARET_IGNORE_TOPICS="/clock:/parameter_events"

     # Apply filter using a setting file
     source ./caret_topic_filter.bash
     ```

   - Launch the target application

     ```sh
     ros2 run caret_demos end_to_end_sample
     ```

2. Open another terminal and start a LTTng session with the following commands

   - Trace data will be stored into the directory whose path is defined as `{ROS_TRACE_DIR}/{SESSION_NAME}`.
     - `ROS_TRACE_DIR` is an environmental variable whose default value is `~/.ros/tracing`  
        (Optional) You can set `ROS_TRACE_DIR` environment variable to change a destination directory where recorded trace data will be stored
     - `SESSION_NAME` means a session name given with `-s` option for `ros2 caret record` command
   - Press "Enter" key to start a session

   ```sh
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   source ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/local_setup.bash

   # (Optional) Set a destination directory
   mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/evaluate
   export ROS_TRACE_DIR=~/ros2_ws/evaluate

   ros2 caret record -s e2e_sample

   # Start session with pressing Enter key
   ```

3. Press "Enter" key to stop the LTTng session in the terminal where the LTTng session runs

4. Stop the target application

!!!info
      If you'd like to start measurement immediately after launch, reverse Step 1 and Step 2.
      You can start a Lttng session first before executing a target application as well.
      However, if recording is started during launch of a target application, it may cause missing recordings.
      Please start recording either before launch is started or after launch is completed.

      You may find that size of recorded data is strangely smaller than expected after updating LTTng to 2.13 if you apply CARET to a large application like [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) which has hundreds of nodes. You have to suspect that maximum number of file descriptors is not enough in the case. You can check the number with `ulimit -n` command. The default maximum number is 1024, but it is not enough for the large application. You can avoid this problem by enlarging the maximum number with executing the command; `ulimit -n 65536`.

## Starting LTTng session via ROS launch

You can start LTTng session using ROS launch system. When you have started a target application in one terminal, you have to open another terminal for starting a LTTng session as explained above. Operating multiple terminals is laborious for users. Starting LTTng session along with application by ROS launch is a reasonable way to apply CARET repeatedly.

1. Create a launch file for a target application in ROS general manner if you haven't made it

   ```py
   # launch/end_to_end_sample.launch.py
   import launch
   import launch_ros.actions


   def generate_launch_description():
       return launch.LaunchDescription([
           launch_ros.actions.Node(
               package='caret_demos', executable='end_to_end_sample', output='screen'),
       ])
   ```

2. Add description to start a LTTng session

   ```py
   # launch/end_to_end_sample_with_lttng_session.launch.py
   import launch
   import launch_ros.actions
   from tracetools_launch.action import Trace


   def generate_launch_description():
       return launch.LaunchDescription([
           Trace(
               session_name='e2e_sample',
               events_kernel=[],
               events_ust=['ros2*']
           ),
           launch_ros.actions.Node(
               package='caret_demos', executable='end_to_end_sample', output='screen'),
       ])
   ```

3. Launch a target application and a LTTng session via the launch file

   - Environment settings are still needed, but all operations are performed in just one terminal

   ```sh
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   source ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/local_setup.bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash

   export LD_PRELOAD=$(readlink -f ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/caret_trace/lib/libcaret.so)

   source ./caret_topic_filter.bash

   ros2 launch caret_demos end_to_end_sample_with_lttng_session.launch.py
   ```

## Advanced: Useful settings for launch file

- The following script shows advanced settings for a launch file
- `caret_session` option is used to set a session name. If not assigned, datetime (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS) is used
- `caret_light` option is used to add another event filter. Only events specified in `caret_event` variable are recorded. In this example, high level events, such as ros2:rclcpp layer, are recorded if `caret_light` is set to "true". This setting will be helpful to record a huge application.
  - Please refer to [tracepoint summary](./cli_tool.md#tracepoint-summary) to find which events are recorded, and modify `caret_event` as you want.

```py
# launch/end_to_end_sample_with_lttng_session.launch.py
import launch
import launch_ros.actions
from tracetools_launch.action import Trace

import sys
import datetime
from distutils.util import strtobool


def generate_launch_description():
  caret_session = ""
  caret_event = ["ros2*"]
  caret_light = True

  for arg in sys.argv:
    if arg.startswith("caret_session:="):
      caret_session = arg.split(":=")[1]
    elif arg.startswith("caret_light:="):
      try:
        caret_light = strtobool(arg.split(":=")[1]) # 0 or 1
      except:
        print("Invalid arguments 'caret_light'.")
        print("Start tracing with 'ros2*'.")

  if caret_light:
    caret_event = [
            "ros2:*callback*",
            "ros2_caret:*callback*",
            "ros2:dispatch*",
            "ros2_caret:dispatch*",
            "ros2:rclcpp*" ,
            "ros2_caret:rclcpp*" ,
            "ros2_caret:rmw*",
            "ros2:rmw_take",
            "*callback_group*",
            "ros2_caret:*executor",
            "ros2_caret:dds_bind*",
            "ros2:rcl_*init",
            "ros2_caret:rcl_*init",
            "ros2_caret:caret_init"]

  if caret_session == "":
    dt_now = datetime.datetime.now()
    caret_session = "autoware_launch_trace_" + dt_now.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")

  return launch.LaunchDescription([
    Trace(
      session_name=caret_session,
      events_kernel=[],
      events_ust=caret_event
    ),
    launch_ros.actions.Node(
        package='caret_demos', executable='end_to_end_sample', output='screen'),
  ])
```
