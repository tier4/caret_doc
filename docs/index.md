# Chain-Aware ROS Evaluation Tool (CARET)

CARET is one of performance analysis tool dedicated with ROS 2 applications. It is able to measure not only callback latency and communication latency, but also path latency, in other words, chain of node or callback. As additional tracepoints are introduced by function hook, tracing resolution is improved.

Features and capabilities are shown below.

Features:

- Low overhead with LTTng-based tracepoints for sampling events in ROS/DDS layer
- Flexible tracepoints added by function hooking with LD_PRELOAD
- Python-based API for flexible data analysis and visualization
- Application-layer events tracing by cooperation with TILDE, runtime message tracer

Capabilities:

- Performance measurement from several aspects
  - Callback latency, frequency, and period
  - Topic communication latency, frequency, and period
  - Node latency
  - Path latency
    - End-to-end latency of software if path from input to output is selected
- Visualization of scheduling for callback execution
- Filtering function to ignore specific nodes and topics
- Search of target paths to trace
- Trace of application events like consumption of buffered topic message
  - `/tf` (planned for v0.3.x release)
  - `message_filters` (supported by TILDE)
  - `image_transport` (supported by TILDE)

## Tracing flow with CARET

![measurement_flow](./imgs/measurement_flow.svg)

CARET gives you capability of tracing your application with introducing new tracepoints to ROS and DDS layer while it utilized original tracepoints for [`ros2_tracing`](https://gitlab.com/ros-tracing/ros2_tracing).

CARET is served as only source code, but not as `apt` package, so far.  
CARET hooks dedicated functions to those defined in dynamic library in order to add tracepoints.  
The fork of rclcpp which has CARET-dedicated tracepoints is delivered.
You have to build CARET and your application if you want to use.

After you run your application with CARET, you will get recorded data which includes events, metadata and timestamp. You have to write a configuration file, called architecture file, in which you defines node latency and target path, before you analyze the data set.

You will visualize trace data with the architecture file and `CARET_analyze` package, including API for data analysis.
`CARET_analyze` is designed on assumption that users analyze trace data on Jupyter Notebook.
