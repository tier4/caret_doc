# Known issues

## Install

### Warnings caused by `setup.py`

- Issue
  - The following warnings happen when building CARET

```sh
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/setuptools/command/develop.py:40: EasyInstallDeprecationWarning: easy_install command is deprecated.
!!

        ********************************************************************************
        Please avoid running ``setup.py`` and ``easy_install``.
        Instead, use pypa/build, pypa/installer or other
        standards-based tools.

        See https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/917 for details.
        ********************************************************************************

!!
  easy_install.initialize_options(self)
```

```sh
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/setuptools/_distutils/cmd.py:66: SetuptoolsDeprecationWarning: setup.py install is deprecated.
!!

        ********************************************************************************
        Please avoid running ``setup.py`` directly.
        Instead, use pypa/build, pypa/installer or other
        standards-based tools.

        See https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html for details.
        ********************************************************************************

!!
  self.initialize_options()
```

- Cause
  - Python3 deprecates building with `setup.py`
  - However, `setup.py` is used to build ROS 2 by colcon
- Workaround
  - This warning does not prevent CARET from working and does not require any action
  - However, if you really want to remove the warning, the following steps can be taken to suppress the warning

```sh
export PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore:"setup.py install is deprecated.",ignore:"easy_install command is deprecated."
```

## Build

### Conflicts of dependency on `libtracetools.so`

- Issue
  - The following errors happen when building a target application with certain packages like `pcl_ros`
    - ``undefined reference to `ros_trace_message_construct'``
    - ``undefined reference to `ros_trace_rclcpp_intra_publish'``
    - ``undefined reference to `ros_trace_dispatch_subscription_callback'``
    - and so on
- Cause
  - `~/ros2_caret_ws/install/tracetools/lib/libtracetools.so` needs to be linked, but `/opt/ros/humble/lib/libtracetools.so` is referred when using some packages
  - For instance, `pcl_ros` package has `/opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake` which enforces `/opt/ros/humble/lib/libtracetools.so` to be linked
- Workaround 1
  - Remove `/opt/ros/humble/lib/libtracetools.so;` from `/opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake`

```sh
sudo cp /opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake /opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake.bak
sudo sed -i -e 's/\/opt\/ros\/humble\/lib\/libtracetools.so;//g' /opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake
```

- Workaround 2
  - If the error persists after applying workaround 1, modify all libraries

```sh
sudo grep -rl '/opt/ros/humble/lib/libtracetools.so;' /opt/ros/humble/share --include="*.cmake" |
    while read -r f; do
        echo "Delete reference to libtracetools from $f"
        sudo cp "$f" "$f.bak"
        sudo sed -i 's|/opt/ros/humble/lib/libtracetools.so;||g' "$f"
    done
```

- Workaround 3
  - If the error persists even after applying workaround 1 and 2, ensure that the CARET tracetools library is used by explicitly setting `-Dtracetools_DIR`
  - This can occur especially when the target application is built with `--merge-install`

```sh
--cmake-args -Dtracetools_DIR="$HOME/ros2_caret_ws/install/tracetools/share/tracetools/cmake"
```

### SYSTEM's rclcpp is referred

- Issue
  - The following error happens when building a target application

```sh
/opt/ros/humble/include/rclcpp/rclcpp/publisher.hpp: In member function ‘void rclcpp::Publisher<MessageT, AllocatorT>::do_inter_process_publish(const ROSMessageType&)’:
/opt/ros/humble/include/rclcpp/rclcpp/publisher.hpp:452:5: error: too few arguments to function ‘void ros_trace_rclcpp_publish(const void*, const void*, uint64_t)’
  452 |     TRACEPOINT(rclcpp_publish, nullptr, static_cast<const void *>(&msg));
```

- Cause
  - To build with CARET, caret/rclcpp should be used. However, in case rclcpp in SYSTEM ( `/opt/ros/humble` ) is used for some reasons, build will fail
  - Take `pcl_ros` for example, `/opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake` enforces `/opt/ros/humble/include/rclcpp` to be referred. So that caret/rclcpp is not used and building a package depending on `pcl_ros` will fail
- Workaround 1
  - Remove `/opt/ros/humble/include/rclcpp;` from `/opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake`

```sh
sudo cp /opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake /opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake.bak2
sudo sed -i -e 's/\/opt\/ros\/humble\/include\/rclcpp;//g' /opt/ros/humble/share/pcl_ros/cmake/export_pcl_rosExport.cmake
```

- Workaround 2
  - If the error persists after applying workaround 1, modify all libraries

```sh
sudo grep -rl '/opt/ros/humble/include/rclcpp;' /opt/ros/humble/share --include="*.cmake" |
    while read -r f; do
        echo "Delete reference to rclcpp from $f"
        sudo cp "$f" "$f.bak"
        sudo sed -i 's|/opt/ros/humble/include/rclcpp;||g' "$f"
    done
```

- Workaround 3
  - If the error persists even after applying workaround 1 and 2, ensure that the CARET rclcpp is used by explicitly setting `-Drclcpp_DIR`
  - This can occur especially when the target application is built with `--merge-install`

```sh
--cmake-args -Drclcpp_DIR="$HOME/ros2_caret_ws/install/rclcpp/share/rclcpp/cmake"
```

### Build using ament_cmake

- Issue
  - The following error happens when building a target application using ament_cmake
    - `error: too few arguments to function ‘void ros_trace_rclcpp_publish`
- Cause
  - `SYSTEM` is added as dependencies in ament_cmake_auto by [this PR](https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/commit/799183ab9bcfd9b66df0de9b644abaf8c9b78e84). As a result, ros2/rclcpp is used rather than CARET/rclcpp in some packages
- Workaround
  - Remove `SYSTEM` from dependencies in ament_cmake_auto

```sh
cd /opt/ros/humble/share/ament_cmake_auto/cmake/
sudo cp ament_auto_add_executable.cmake ament_auto_add_executable.cmake.bak
sudo cp ament_auto_add_library.cmake ament_auto_add_library.cmake.bak
sudo sed -i -e 's/SYSTEM//g' ament_auto_add_executable.cmake
sudo sed -i -e 's/SYSTEM//g' ament_auto_add_library.cmake
```

## Recording

### Only metadata is recorded

- Issue
  - Only metadata file (`~/.ros/tracing/ooo/ust/uid/1000/64-bit/metadata`) is created, and the size of the trace data is always about 28 KByte
- Cause
  - The size of LTTng buffer is too large for some environments
  - It happens especially when
    - Recording on Docker
    - and the number of CPUs is large (e.g. 24 cores)
- Workaround
  - Decrease the number of the LTTng buffer size
    - [lttng_impl.py](https://github.com/tier4/ros2_tracing/blob/64545052077d38c770b0c6e73fad221bcaba0583/tracetools_trace/tracetools_trace/tools/lttng_impl.py#L157)
      - Rebuild is not required after the modification
    - Please note that decreasing the buffer size may cause tracer discarded
