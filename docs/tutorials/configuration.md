# Configuration

Please download [the architecture file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tier4/caret_demos/main/samples/end_to_end_sample/architecture.yaml) and use it for visualization.

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/evaluate
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tier4/caret_demos/main/samples/end_to_end_sample/architecture.yaml

Configuration is an advanced topic for beginners. This section only provides the architecture file for [the next section of visualization](./visualization.md).
