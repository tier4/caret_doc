# Communication

Communication latency is an expression of how much time it takes for a topic message to travel from source callback to next callback.

$$
l_{comm} = t_{sub} - t_{pub}
$$

!!! Info
        In this definition, communication latency is affected by the scheduling of callbacks, and includes not only the communication latency of the DDS, but also the delay due to scheduling.
        For example, if multiple callbacks are dispatched simultaneously, the communication latency may include the execution time of other callbacks.
        For more information on scheduling, see [Event and latency_definitions | overview](../index.md#detailed-sequence).

ROS communication is performed by the subscription side for intra-process communication and inter-process communication.
Since ROS communication is capable of many-to-many communication, there are cases where both intra-process and inter-process communication are performed in a single publish.
In CARET, communication is divided into 1:1 pairs and latency is calculated.

## Intra process communication

A simplified sequence diagram focusing only on the relevant data flow is shown below.

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "UserCode\n(Publisher Side)" as Callback
participant "rclcpp\n (Publisher/Subscription)" as Rclcpp
participant "rclcpp\n (Buffer)" as Buffer
participant rcl
participant LTTng

== Publisher ==

-> Callback
activate Callback

Callback -> Rclcpp : publish
activate Rclcpp
Rclcpp -> LTTng : intra process publish

Rclcpp -> Buffer : enqueue
activate Buffer
Rclcpp -> rcl : notify
deactivate Rclcpp
activate rcl

deactivate Callback

== Subscription ==

rcl -> Rclcpp : dispatch
deactivate rcl
activate Rclcpp

Rclcpp -> Buffer : take
Buffer -> Rclcpp: dequeue
deactivate Buffer
Rclcpp -> LTTng: sample dispatch_intra_subscription_callback
Rclcpp -> LTTng : sample callback_start
Rclcpp -> Callback : callback start

activate Callback

`to_dataframe` API returns a table which has the following columns.

| Column                   | Type        | Description             |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| rclcpp_publish_timestamp | System time | Publish time in rclcpp. |
| callback_start_timestamp | System time | Callback start time     |
