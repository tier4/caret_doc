# Latency definition

CARET mainly measures the following

- Callback latency
- Communication latency
- Node latency
- Path latency

The simplified sequence diagram shown below illustrates each definition.

![Latency overview](../../imgs/latency_overview.png)

Here, the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents layers.
The red line represents message flow.
A message is received in the subscription callback and the processed data is published to the next node.
In this way, information is propagated from the sensor node to the actuator node.

CARET samples events for latency calculation. The following three items are main types of the events.

- Callback start
- Callback end
- Publish

Difference of timestamp between two events are corresponded to latency.

For a more detailed definition, see

- [Callback](./callback.md)
- [Communication](./communication.md)
- [Node](./node.md)
- [Path](./path.md)

CARET provides time series data of events through Python objects.
Time series data can be retrieved with the Python objects which have to_dataframe API.
All objects are capable of retrieving time-series data are listed below.

| Target                              | Configuration required? |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [Path](./path.md)                   | Yes                     |
| [Node](./node.md)                   | Yes                     |
| [Communication](./communication.md) | No                      |
| [Callback](./callback.md)           | No                      |
| [Publisher](./publisher.md)         | No                      |
| [Subscription](./subscription.md)   | No                      |
| [Timer](./timer.md)                 | No                      |

Here, for Path and Node, definitions must be given manually.
For details on setting the definitions, see [Configuration](../../configuration/index.md).

## Detailed Sequence

Below is a detailed sequence diagram of the SingleThreadedExecutor, from publish in the callback to the execution of the subscription callback.

```plantuml
@startuml
title: Definition of major tracepoints

participant UserCode
participant ROS 2
participant DDS
participant LTTng

== Publisher Side ==

activate ROS 2
activate UserCode
UserCode -> ROS 2: publish()
activate ROS 2
ROS 2 -> LTTng: sample rclcpp_publish \n sample rclcpp_intra_publish


ROS 2 -> DDS: dds_write()
deactivate ROS 2
activate DDS
DDS -> LTTng: sample dds_write

UserCode -> ROS 2 : callback_end
deactivate UserCode
deactivate ROS 2
deactivate DDS


== Subscription Side ==

UserCode -> ROS 2 : spin()
activate DDS
activate ROS 2

loop
    ROS 2 -> ROS 2 : wait until next event
    activate ROS 2
    DDS -> ROS 2: <notify> on_data_available
    ROS 2 -> LTTng : sample on_data_available
    deactivate ROS 2

    deactivate DDS
    ROS 2 -> DDS : reset ready-set, take messages
    activate DDS
    DDS -> ROS 2
    deactivate DDS

    group execute timer callbacks
    end

    group execute subscription callbacks
        ROS 2 -> LTTng: sample callback_start
        ROS 2 -> UserCode: callback start
        activate UserCode
        UserCode -> ROS 2: callback end
        deactivate UserCode
        ROS 2 -> LTTng: sample callback_end
    end

    group execute service callbacks
    end

    group execute client callbacks
    end
end

deactivate ROS 2
@enduml
```

Here, each element indicates the following

- UserCode is a callback
- ROS 2 is rclcpp, rcl, and rmw
- DDS is FastDDS or CycloneDDS
- LTTng is the output destination for tracepoints

Within the spin of Subscription, the executable callbacks are executed sequentially.

In this way, the executor schedules callbacks.
If there are multiple executable callbacks, they are executed sequentially, so other callbacks may have to wait.
