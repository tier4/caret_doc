# Architecture file

An architecture file is a YAML-based file which describes structure of a target application.
It contains the following information.

- Definition of the data path to be measured
- Information about the structure of the software to be measured
  - Executor information
  - Node information (e.g. node latency definition)

## File format

A sample of the architecture file is as follows.

## Callback identification

It's convenient for users to give a name to a callback function for its identification. However, in the context of ROS 2, only an address is given to a callback.

Addresses change with each launch of an application.
This makes it difficult to handle callbacks by address when evaluating performance of them.
For example, if you want to compare the execution time of a particular callback for each launch, you have to find address to select target callbacks.

CARET helps users to give a name to a callback, but it is not directly associated with its address due to the reason as explained above.

In order to tackle the issue, CARET associates a name with an address of callback with using combination of following data.

- `node_name`
- `callback_type`
- `period_ns` / `topic_name`
- `symbol`
- `construction_order`

By using this information to match `callback_name` and callback address,
each `callback_name` will always refer to identical callbacks without being aware of callback address.
