## Implementation of tracepoints with function hooking

CARET adopts function hooking mainly for adding new trace points. On the other hand, existing tracepoints, which are built in ROS 2, are also re-defined by function hooking because CARET adds the function to manage tracepoint state.

Here is the pseudo code for hook functions.

```C++
void ros_trace_callback_start(TRACEPOINT_ARGS) {
  // Record trace data only if current callback is allowed to record
  if (controller.is_allowed(TRACEPOINT_ARGS)) {
    tracepoint(TRACEPOINT_ARGS); // LTTng tracepoint
  }
}

void ros_trace_XXX_init(TRACEPOINT_ARGS)
{
  // Wrapper function for tracepoint.
  // This function is executed with delay.
  // This function is executed either from the record at the end of this function
  // or from TraceNode's timer callback.
  // Duplicate data are resolved with caret_analyze.
  static auto record = [](TRACEPOINT_ARGS, now) {
    // Record trace data only if current callback is allowed to record
    if (controller.is_allowed(TRACEPOINT_ARGS)) {
      tracepoint(TRACEPOINT_ARGS, now); // LTTng tracepoint
    }
  };

  auto now = clock.now(); // Measure immediately after function call

  if (!data_container.is_assigned_XXX()) {
    data_container.assign_XXX(record);
  }

  // Store TRACEPOINT_ARGS in memory.
  data_container.store_XXX(TRACEPOINT_ARGS, now);

  record(TRACEPOINT_ARGS, now);
}

```

`ros_trace_callback_start` is an example of hook functions to trace callback start. It is a kind of trace points for collecting events related to application
s behavior, and so called runtime trace point.

`ros_trace_XXX_init` is an example of hook function to get identification of application's component. It is expected to be called when application is launched and initialized. The trace point is categorized into initialization trace point.

A set of identifications such as a callback address or node name is given as `TRACEPOINT_ARGS`.
Several kinds of initialization trace point are served, and each of them is attached to different kind of component; executor, node, callback, publisher, subscriber, and etc. For example, one is called to collect node's identification while another is called to collect publisher's identification.

Identifications collected from different trace points share same addresses or names as elements. By connecting such identifications by the same addresses or names, CARET is able to help you to find application's structure.

See [Initialization trace points](../trace_points/initialization_trace_points.md) for details.

## clock recorder

CARET can select simulation time, represented as `sim_time`, for visualization.
`sim_time` can be recorded by running the `simtime_recorder` node, which adds trace points for `sim_time` recording.

```bash
ros2 run caret_trace clock_recorder
```

`ClockRecorder` node wakes up per second and records a pair of `sim_time` and system time.
The pair is used to convert system time to simulation time.
