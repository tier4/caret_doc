CARET is served as only source code, but not as apt package, so far. CARET hooks dedicated functions to those defined in dynamic library in order to add tracepoints. The fork of rclcpp which has CARET-dedicated tracepoints is delivered. You have to build CARET and your application if you want to use. After you run your application with CARET, you will measure (trace) your application get a set of trace data. You have to write a configuration file, called architecture file, in which you defines node latency and target path, before you analyze the data set. You will visualize trace data with the architecture file and CARET_analyze package, including API for data analysis.

CARET collects data, which include timestamps, from tracepoints embedded in user application, ROS 2 and DDS. The data set is stored into a storage as \"Trace Data\". A set of trace data is divided into two sections by CARET_analyze package after loading trace data; Architecture and Runtime Data. Architecture object includes description of target application's structure. This object can be reused unless structure of the target application or name of the components is changed. Runtime Data object has data sampled during execution of the target application. The sampled data includes timestamps, whose value are different per execution, obtained from tracepoints. Architecture object and Runtime Data object are implemented as Python-based classes. The structure of their classes are designed based on the structure of ROS applications which are constructed of executors, nodes, callback functions, and topic messages. ROS-based structure makes CARET's API friendly for ROS users. They are able to find target nodes, topic messages, or executors if they know their application structure. Architecture object serves APIs to search node chains and define node latency as mentioned in tutorial/architecture file section . Architecture object is reusable after it is saved as a YAML-based file called \"architecture file\". Runtime Data object serves APIs to retrieve pandas.DataFrame -based objects including callback latency or communication. Users can analyze temporal aspects of their applications, with visualization, as they expect. APIs for visualization are also served by CARET_analyze which plays main role to analyze trace data. Cooperation with TILDE, a framework tools to detect deadline overrun # CARET can cooperate with TILDE, a framework tool to detect deadline overrun. TILDE lets CARET trace events in user applications which cannot be traced from ROS/DDS layer. One example of the events is consumption of message buffered in nodes. The events can be observed in only application layer, but CARET cannot observe the events. On the other hand, TILDE can trace application-layer events. It is able to trace execution of callback function to consume a certain buffered message since it annotate message consumption per single message. TILDE serves CARET this capability to trace consumption of buffered message. Todo TILDE is now under development.

definition # This section lists all tracepoints and their definition. Before listing tracepoints. Some tracepoints are used for collecting identification of executors, nodes, callbacks, and topics during application's initialization. They are called initialization tracepoints. The other tracepoints are embedded for sampling timestamps after completion of initialization, and called runtime tracepoints. Almost all of tracepoints supported by CARET are embedded in ROS and DDS layer. CARET utilizes some of the tracepoints embedded in original ROS 2 middleware, which are used for ros2-tracing. Some of the rest tracepoints are added to the fork of ROS 2's rclcpp, the other are introduced by function hooking with LD_PRELOAD. AS explained, tracepoints for CARET is embedded by three ways and they are identified as below. Original tracepoints tracepoints embedded in original ROS 2 middleware which are utilized by ros2-tracing some of tracepoints, for service, action and lifecycle node, are not utilized by CARET Extended tracepoints CARET-dedicated tracepoints added to the fork of rclcpp Hooked tracepoints CARET-dedicated tracepoints introduced by function hooking with LD_PRELOAD Info Please read this section if you are interested in CARET-dedicated tracepoints are extended by the forked rclcpp and LD_PRELOAD. CARET would like to add tracepoints by function hooking as possible. LD_PRELOAD is reasonable to hook functions defined in dynamic library, but it cannot be applied to functions by implemented with C++ template.

CARET can associate an address of original message to that of copied one by message_construct . A certain message is identified with an unique address in rcl layer, it is identified with source_timestamp in DDS layer. All messages communicated via DDS have source_timestamp given automatically, which are introduced for QoS function.A pair of publish and subscription same source_timestamp . CARET utilizes source_timestamp to map transmitted message to received one. CARET maps a message_addr to a published message for intra-process communication, and a source_timestamp to one for inter-communication.

As explained, message_addr and source_timestamp are identifier for transmission flow using publish method. This means that a invoked publish method is mapped to a callback_start . However this does not mean that CARET can map a callback_start to a corresponding publish . CARET can trace a certain flow from publish to callback_start , but the reversed mapping, from callback_start to publish , is not supported by CARET. The capability of mapping between callback_start and publish will be improved in v0.3.* release or later.","title":"Supported tracepoints"},{"location":"design/supported_tracepoints/#tracepoints-definition","text":"This section lists all tracepoints and their definition. Before listing tracepoints. Some tracepoints are used for collecting identification of executors, nodes, callbacks, and topics during application's initialization. They are called initialization tracepoints. The other tracepoints are embedded for sampling timestamps after completion of initialization, and called runtime tracepoints. Almost all of tracepoints supported by CARET are embedded in ROS and DDS layer. CARET utilizes some of the tracepoints embedded in original ROS 2 middleware, which are used for ros2-tracing. Some of the rest tracepoints are added to the fork of ROS 2's rclcpp, the other are introduced by function hooking with LD_PRELOAD. AS explained, tracepoints for CARET is embedded by three ways and they are identified as below. Original tracepoints tracepoints embedded in original ROS 2 middleware which are utilized by ros2-tracing some of tracepoints, for service, action and lifecycle node, are not utilized by CARET Extended tracepoints CARET-dedicated tracepoints added to the fork of rclcpp Hooked tracepoints CARET-dedicated tracepoints introduced by function hooking with LD_PRELOAD Info Please read this section if you are interested in CARET-dedicated tracepoints are extended by the forked rclcpp and LD_PRELOAD. CARET would like to add tracepoints by function hooking as possible. LD_PRELOAD is reasonable to hook functions defined in dynamic library, but it cannot be applied to functions by implemented with C++ template. Such template-based implementation is mapped into binary file after it is built or compiled. Original rclcpp uses C++ template for some functions like intra-process communication, for example.

CARET maps a message_addr to a published message for intra-process communication, and a source_timestamp to one for inter-communication.","title":"Tracepoints for representing flow of message transmission"},{"location":"design/supported_tracepoints/#tracepoints-for-representing-flow-of-callback-execution-after-message-reception","text":"graph LR source_timestamp[[source_timestamp]] message_intra_sub[[message_addr]] message_intra[[message_addr]] callback[[callback]] source_timestamp[[source_timestamp]] source_timestamp_sub[source_timestamp] dispatch_subscription_callback[dispatch_subscription_callback<ul><li>message_addr</li><li>callback</li><li>source_timestamp</li><li>message_timestamp</li></ul>] dispatch_intra_process_subscription_callback[dispatch_intra_process_subscription_callback<ul><li>message_addr</li><li>callback</li><li>message_timestamp</li></ul>] callback_end_[callback_end<ul><li>callback</li></ul>] callback_start[callback_start<ul><li>callback</li><li>is_intra_process</li></ul>] source_timestamp --Inter Process Communication--> source_timestamp_sub message_intra --Intra Process Communication--> message_intra_sub message_intra_sub --> dispatch_intra_process_subscription_callback dispatch_intra_process_subscription_callback --> callback callback --> callback_start callback --> callback_end_ dispatch_subscription_callback --> callback source_timestamp_sub --> dispatch_subscription_callback As well as flow of message transmission, a message is identified by message_addr for intra-process communication, but source_timestamp for inter-process communication. message_addr and source_timestamp is mapped a corresponding callback_start . As explained, message_addr and source_timestamp are identifier for transmission flow using publish method. This means that a invoked publish method is mapped to a callback_start . However this does not mean that CARET can map a callback_start to a corresponding publish . CARET can trace a certain flow from publish to callback_start , but the reversed mapping, from callback_start to publish , is not supported by CARET. The capability of mapping between callback_start and publish will be improved in v0.3.* release or later.","title":"Tracepoints for representing flow of callback execution after message reception"},{"location":"tips/about_callback_graph/","text":"\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 # ROS \u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306b\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u3067\u8a18\u8ff0\u3055\u308c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306b\u4f34\u3044\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u5358\u4f4d\u306e\u30ec\u30a4\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\uff08\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30a4\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\uff09\u3092\u628a\u63e1\u3057\u305f\u3044\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u751f\u3058\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u3057\u304b\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u4e00\u3064\u306e\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u8907\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30a4\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u3092\u8003\u3048\u305f\u969b\u306b\u4e0d\u90fd\u5408\u304c\u751f\u3058\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u4e0a\u56f3\u306f\u3001 /lidar \u3068 /camera \u30c8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u30b5\u30d6\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\uff12\u3064\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u7d71\u5408\u3057\u305f\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u3092 /fusion \u306b\u30d1\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3059\u308b TargetNode \u3092\u4f8b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u793a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 /lidar \u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u5909\u6570\u306b\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u683c\u7d0d\u3057\u3001/camera \u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u5185\u3067\u7d71\u5408\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u203b CARET \u3067\u306f \u3001\u5909\u6570\u3092\u7d4c\u7531\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u9593\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u6e21\u3057\u3092 Variable Passing \u3068\u547c\u3073\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3078\u8a18\u8ff0\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u3053\u306e\u6642\u3001 TargetNode \u306e\u30ec\u30a4\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u306f\u6b21\u306e\uff12\u3064\u304c\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af C \u2192 \u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af D\uff08/lidar \u30c8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af \u2192 /fusion \u30c8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30d1\u30b9\uff09 \u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af D\uff08/camera \u30c8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af \u2192 /fusion \u30c8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30d1\u30b9\uff09 \u3053\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u4e00\u3064\u306e\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u8907\u6570\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306f\u3001\u6307\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u30d1\u30b9\u6bce\u306b\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30a4\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u3092\u69cb\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u7570\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u305d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001 CARET \u3067\u306f ROS \u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8a18\u8ff0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6574\u7406 A node is an executable that uses ROS to communicate with other nodes.

communication latency (inter-node) node latency (intra-node) path latency (intra-node & inter-node) The following figure shows definition of node latency and path latency. Callback latency can be defined as execution time of a callback function and can be measured with simple tracepoints. Communication latency between nodes can be defined as time from publish invoking to subscription callback invoking. Identifying callback and topic is not difficult so that their latency are calculated easily. However, it's difficult to define node latency and path latency mechanically. Node latency, time elapsed from input to output in a certain node, cannot be identified in ROS layer and its definition depends on patterns of application implementation. Path latency, which is defined as combination of node latency and communication latency, depends implementation patterns as well as node latency. Paths are combination of nodes which are connected via topic messages. The number of paths in a application is equaled to that of nodes combination, so that complicated and large application has large number of paths. To deal with such difficulty of defining node and path latency mechanically, CARET requires users to define node and path latency manually via a configuration file, called \" architecture file \". Overview of an architecture file # An architecture file has two sections; application structure and latency definition. Application structure section describes components of a target application and their connections, represented as executors, nodes, callback groups, callbacks, topics, and timers. CARET can create a template architecture file including only application structure section. The application structure section remains same unless the structure is changed or component is renamed. On the other hand, latency definition section in the template architecture file is empty just before users add any definition. Users are expected to add definitions of node latency and path latency in the template file. CARET helps users to add definition of path latency with Python API. However, users have to add definition of node latency manually with editing the architecture file. The following sections explains how to create an architecture file and add latency definition. How to generate an architecture file # This section explains how to generate an architecture file which has minimum description. Launch Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter Lab) mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/evaluate && cd ~/ros2_ws/evaluate source ~/ros2_caret_ws/install/setup.bash jupyter-lab Generate an architecture file from measured data as below from caret_analyze import Architecture # Read description of application's architecture from measured data arch = Architecture ( 'lttng' , './e2e_sample' ) # Save description as an architecture file arch . export ( 'architecture.yaml' ) # Check if the architecture file is created ! readlink - f ./ architecture . yaml # /home/user/ros2_caret_ws/eval/architecture.yaml How to define a target path # Load the yaml-based architecture file as below from caret_analyze import Architecture , check_procedure arch = Architecture ( 'yaml' , './architecture.yaml' ) Choose source node and destination node in a path arch.search_paths extract all candidates of the path paths = arch . search_paths ( '/sensor_dummy_node' , # source node '/actuator_dummy_node' ) # destination node If a target application is large and complicated, arch.search_paths method may consume time more than 1 minute. For decreasing consumed time, you can ignore nodes and topics and specify depth of search. Refer to \u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5 for more details. Check the path as you expected You will find multiple candidates of the path. You can check which candidate is expected as target.

Some nodes subscribe input messages and invoke callback function where they publish output messages. These nodes has direct relationship between input and output. Other nodes subscribe input messages and invoke callback functions where they buffer them, and invoke different callback functions consume input messages and publish output message. In the latter cases, relationship of input and output is indirect, and intra-node communication is performed with using multiple callback functions. message_filters is another cause to increase the number of implementation patterns. Therefore, CARET has to deal with several types of node implementation to measure node latency. CARET serve a function to define node latency with an architecture file. An architecture file has an item of mesasge_context , which indicates relation between input message and output message. This item should be defined by users as below. Check which node latency should be configured path.verify() method, as shown in the following example, tells you which node latency should be defined. from caret_analyze import Architecture arch = Architecture ( 'yaml' , './architecture.yaml' ) path = arch . get_path ( 'target_path' ) path . verify () --- Output text as below --- WARNING : 2021 - 12 - 20 19 : 14 : 03 | Detected \"message_contest is None\" .

Callback latency can be defined as execution time of a callback function and can be measured with simple tracepoints. Communication latency between nodes can be defined as time from publish invoking to subscription callback invoking. Identifying callback and topic is not difficult so that their latency are calculated easily. However, it's difficult to define node latency and path latency mechanically. Node latency, time elapsed from input to output in a certain node, cannot be identified in ROS layer and its definition depends on patterns of application implementation. Path latency, which is defined as combination of node latency and communication latency, depends implementation patterns as well as node latency. Paths are combination of nodes which are connected via topic messages. The number of paths in a application is equaled to that of nodes combination, so that complicated and large application has large number of paths.

Sampling data are stored into ring-buffer as explained LTTng documents . After a piece of ring-buffer is occupied, sampling data is stored into next empty piece while the occupied piece is copied to file. If there is no room to store sampling data in all pieces of ring-buffer, sampling data will be discarded. You can avoid this error with the following two approach. to filter topics and nodes which can be ignored with trace filtering explained in the previous section especially, filtering highly-frequent nodes and topics is effective highly-frequent nodes/topics can be identified by checking the summary of trace data to increase size of ring buffer defined in lttng_impl.py","title":"Tracer discarded error"},{"location":"tutorials/visualization/","text":"Performance visualization # CARET serves Python APIs to visualize trace data for users to analyze applications' performance.

The app objects provides users latency of callbacks, communication, and paths. Application class is similar to Architecture class which describes structure of the application and their interfaces are similar. In addition, Application class has interfaces to get latency. Basic API to get latency # This section will explain APIs to get callback latency. The following code is one of examples to get callback latency. # Get a callback instance, which has latency information, from app callback = app . get_callback ( '/timer_driven_node/callback_0' ) # Get time-series variation of latency t , latency_ns = callback . to_timeseries () # Get histogram of latency bins , latency_ns = callback . to_histogram () Though this example shows callback latency, CARET serves API to get communication latency. callback.to_dataframe() will provides pandas.DataFrame based object including raw timestamps which is obtained from tracepoints. Todo Sorry for not providing CARET's API list, but we'll provide it in the near future. Visualizing latency of node chain with message flow # CARET provides some APIs to visualize measured data. With message flow, which is one of effective visualizations, users can understand what happens and where is bottleneck in target applications. Execute the following code for visualization with message flow. from caret_analyze.plot import message_flow path = app . get_path ( 'target_path' ) message_flow ( path ) The following figure will appear if message_flow method is successful. The horizontal axis shows time line. On the other hand, the vertical axis shows elements of the node chain ( target_path ), which include callback functions and topic messages from input to output. Each colorful line shows how a certain input message is propagated to callback functions and topic communications. Gray rectangles show execution timing of callback functions. If your mouse pointer is put over one of gray rectangles, latency of callback functions will be shown. You can find latency of a target node chain as well if you put the mouse pointer onto one of colorful lines. CARET serves other APIs for visualization.
